# math-algorithms
This section includes some of the maths algorithms that I learned in my maths class that I decided to program.

## Euclides Algorithm (gcd)
Implementing Euclides Algorihm as a command line program. This program will find the gcd between two numbers using Euclides Algorihm. It will also find the diophantine equation using the Extended Euclides Algorithm. The program will also show all the workings on how to get the answers.
